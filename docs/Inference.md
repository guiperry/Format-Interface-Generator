This is an ambitious and exciting expansion of your `FIG` application! Integrating an inference engine (using `gollm` and Cerebras AI) to assist users throughout the process is a great way to address the limitations and enhance the usability of the tool. Let's outline a plan for implementing this inference build extension.

**I. Core Idea:**

The core idea is to create a Go-based GUI application that integrates the existing `FIG` functionality with an inference engine (powered by Cerebras AI or a smaller `gollm` model) to provide intelligent assistance and automation at each step of the process: YAML definition, bootstrapping, code generation, and test script creation.

```

**III. Implementation Details:**

1.  **GUI Framework:**

    *   Choose a Go GUI library for creating the interface. Options include:
        *   **Fyne:** A cross-platform GUI toolkit with a focus on simplicity. It's a good choice if you want a modern-looking GUI with a relatively small learning curve.
        *   **Gio:** An immediate-mode GUI library that offers high performance and flexibility. It's a good choice if you need fine-grained control over the GUI rendering process.
        *   **Walk:** A Windows GUI library that provides a native look and feel on Windows.

    *For this example, let's assume you choose Fyne for its ease of use.*

2.  **Directory Structure:**

    ```
    FIG/
    ├── main.go         (GUI application entry point)
    ├── core/          (Existing FIG core code)
    │   ├── generator/
    │   ├── validator/
    │   └── ...
    ├── ui/             (New GUI components)
    │   ├── yaml_editor.go
    │   ├── bootstrap_view.go
    │   ├── code_generation_view.go
    │   ├── test_generation_view.go
    │   └── ...
    ├── inference/      (New AI integration)
    │   ├── gollm_client.go  (Interface with gollm)
    │   └── cerebras_client.go (Interface with Cerebras AI API)
    ├── formats/
    ├── sources/
    ├── formats.json
    ├── go.mod
    └── go.sum
    ```

3.  **GUI Components (`ui/`):**

    *   **`yaml_editor.go`:**
        *   A text editor component for creating and editing YAML files.
        *   Integrates with the inference engine to provide real-time syntax highlighting, error detection, and suggestions (see below).
    *   **`bootstrap_view.go`:**
        *   A view for selecting YAML files to bootstrap and displaying the bootstrap results.
        *   Integrates with the inference engine to provide error resolution and suggestions for fixing validation issues (see below).
    *   **`code_generation_view.go`:**
        *   A view for selecting formats to generate code for and displaying the code generation results.
        *   Integrates with the inference engine to provide error obviation and proofing (see below).
    *   **`test_generation_view.go`:**
        *   A view for generating and editing test scripts.
        *   Integrates with the inference engine to adapt test scripts to the specific format (see below).

4.  **Inference Engine Integration (`inference/`):**

    *   **`gollm_client.go`:**
        *   Wraps the `gollm` library to provide a simple interface for calling the local inference engine.
        *   Handles model loading, prompt formatting, and response parsing.
    *   **`cerebras_client.go`:**
        *   Implements the necessary logic to interact with Cerebras AI APIs.
        *   This would include authentication, API endpoint calls, and response handling.

**IV. AI Assistance at Each Step:**

1.  **Defining a YAML Format (YAML Editor):**

    *   **Real-time Syntax Highlighting:** Highlight YAML syntax errors in real time.
    *   **Error Detection:** Use the inference engine to detect common errors in the YAML structure (e.g., missing keys, incorrect data types, invalid expressions).
    *   **Code Completion and Suggestions:** Provide code completion and suggestions for YAML keys, data types, and field names based on the context.
    *   **Format Adherence Suggestions:** Based on expected structures make suggestions on missing lines.
    *   **Example:** If the user types `type: ui`, the inference engine could suggest `type: uint32` based on the expected data type for the field.

2.  **Bootstrapping Formats with Reformation Error Resolution (Bootstrap View):**

    *   **Error Explanation:** Provide more detailed explanations of the validation errors reported by the `FIG` validator.
    *   **Suggested Fixes:** Use the inference engine to suggest fixes for the validation errors, such as correcting data types, adding missing fields, or adjusting expressions.
    *   **Automatic Code Correction:** In some cases, automatically correct the validation errors based on the inference engine's suggestions. (with user confirmation)
        *The user will have a diff of what was proposed to be change
    *   **Error Analysis:** Log a message and send information to the API to report and have proper models

3.  **Generating Code (Code Generation View):**

    *   **Error Obviation:** Use the inference engine to identify potential errors in the generated code, such as incorrect type conversions, missing error handling, or inefficient code patterns. The code would need to be sent to the API, checked for output
    *   **Code Proofing:** Use the inference engine to proofread the generated code and suggest improvements to its readability, maintainability, and performance.
        * The user will have a diff of what was proposed to be change

4.  **Generating Test Scripts (Test Generation View):**

    *   **Adapt Test Scripts:** Use the inference engine to automatically adapt the generated test scripts to the specific format, including:
        *   Creating realistic sample data.
        *   Implementing the correct sequence of `Write` and `Read` calls for the format.
        *   Adding appropriate verification logic using `reflect.DeepEqual` or `bytes.Equal`.
       * The user will have a diff of what was proposed to be change
    * **Add New Test Cases:** Add new test cases to improve code quality

**V. Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Set up the GUI:**
    *   Choose a Go GUI library (Fyne) and create the basic GUI layout with the four main views (YAML editor, bootstrap view, code generation view, test generation view).
2.  **Integrate Existing FIG Functionality:**
    *   Import and integrate the existing `FIG` core code (validator, generator, etc.) into the GUI application.
    *   Create functions to call the `FIG` functions from the GUI views and display the results.
3.  **Implement Inference Engine Integration:**
    *   Create the `gollm_client.go` and `cerebras_client.go` files.
    *   Implement functions to load the `gollm` model and make API calls to Cerebras AI.
4.  **Add AI Assistance to Each View:**
    *   Implement the logic to call the inference engine from each GUI view and provide intelligent assistance to the user.
5.  **Test and Refine:**
    *   Test the GUI application thoroughly and refine the AI assistance based on user feedback.

**VI. Example Code Snippets (Illustrative):**

*   **GUI with Fyne (Conceptual):**

```go
package main

import (
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2"
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2/app"
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2/container"
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2/widget"
	"project/core"
	"project/inference"
)

func main() {
	a := app.New()
	w := a.NewWindow("Format Interface Generator")

	// Init local gollm
	client := inference.NewGollmClient()
	client.Start()

	// Tabs for different views
	tabs := container.NewAppTabs(
		container.NewTabItem("YAML Editor", widget.NewLabel("YAML Editor Content")),
		container.NewTabItem("Bootstrap", widget.NewLabel("Bootstrap View Content")),
		container.NewTabItem("Code Generation", widget.NewLabel("Code Generation Content")),
		container.NewTabItem("Test Generation", widget.NewLabel("Test Generation Content")),
	)

	w.SetContent(tabs)
	w.Resize(fyne.NewSize(800, 600))
	w.ShowAndRun()
}

```

**VII. Considerations:**

*   **Model Selection:** Choose an appropriate `gollm` model based on the available resources and the desired level of performance.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully craft the prompts that are sent to the inference engine to get the best results.
*   **API Costs (Cerebras AI):** Be aware of the costs associated with using the Cerebras AI API.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling throughout the application.
*   **User Experience:** Design the GUI to be intuitive and easy to use.

By following this approach, you can create a powerful and user-friendly tool for generating code for binary file formats. The integration of the inference engine will provide intelligent assistance and automation, making the process easier and more efficient.
